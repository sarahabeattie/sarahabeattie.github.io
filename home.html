          <h2>About Oasis for Girls</h2>
          <p>Founded in 1999, Oasis For Girls partners with young women of color from under-resourced communities in San Francisco to help them cultivate the skills, knowledge, and confidence to discover their dreams and build strong futures.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <a class="expand-link" href="#" data-featherlight="#oasisinfo">More Info</a> | <a class="backtotop" href="#">Back to Top</a>
          </p>
          <div id="oasisinfo" class="more-info">
            <img src="images/OasisHeader.png" alt="oasislogo">
            <h3>The Why</h3>
              <p>Oasis For Girls partners with young women of color aged 14-18 from under-resourced communities in San Francisco many of whom are on the edge of risk, not on anyone’s radar, disengaged or under-supported, or just beginning to dabble in difficulty.</p>
              <br>
              <p>By almost any measure, to be young, female, and of color in San Francisco means the odds are stacked against you. Our girls face more barriers to resources and opportunities, and are disproportionately impacted by systemic inequalities and policies than other girls their age. Many of their peers will not finish high school, enter into high-growth industries, or be able to leave high-poverty neighborhoods.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We believe that comprehensive change in our communities starts with the girls being affected now.</p>

            <h3>The How</h3>
              <p>At Oasis, we start with a baseline of the validity and value of girls’ individual experiences, and support them in developing the tools they already have. Our girl-focused and girl-responsive programs provide participants with access to diverse opportunities and experiences alongside training in personal and interpersonal skills, delivered in a safe, culturally relevant space that emphasizes autonomy, relationship-building, and positive decision-making.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Single-gender programming helps girls stay connected to academic subjects, encourages them to explore new areas of interest, and lets them practice new skills with the support of positive adult allies. Our Springboard Series for Girls is a compound sequence that emphasizes comprehensive development of both internal awareness and external skills through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfoasis.org/what-we-do/create/">writing and the arts</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfoasis.org/what-we-do/envision-career-exploration/">college and career planning</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfoasis.org/what-we-do/rise-life-skills/">building key life skills</a>.</p>

            <h3>The Aha!</h3>
              <p>Over 85% of the young women we serve each year:
                <ul>
                  <li>enhance their writing, behavioral, and positive decision-making skills;</li>
                  <li>increase their knowledge of health, wellness and social justice;</li>
                  <li>demonstrate greater motivation to attend college;</li>
                  <li>and develop career interests in high-demand fields.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>At Oasis, we aim to empower a distinct, often overlooked group of women to recognize the strength of their diverse life experiences and lead the way for equitable, inclusive change, from breaking cycles of poverty to representing other vulnerable groups and advocating against gender and income inequality in their communities.</p>
